Hub
	Layer 1 device
	CAT5 unshielded twisted pair cable with RJ45 connector for connecting PC to hub
	Very similar to how wireless networks work
	Nonintelligent & does not understand the frames being sent through it
		Essentially a multiport repeater
		Receives data and sends it out of all other ports
		Phyiscal topology: Star (central device [the hub] with devices hanging off the hub as spokes [the PCs]; all traffic flows through the central point when communicating between endpoints)
			Good for availability even in the face of a cable break
			Can extend to further distances easily by incorporating signal repeaters
	A hub receives traffic, then amplifies the traffic and sends it to all ports except for the one it received it on (relies on the NICs of the PCs to recognize when a frame is destined for them based on MAC addresses)
	Logical topology: Bus (single collision domain) because all broadcasts are received by everyone (single broadcast domain)

Bridge
	Layer 2 device
	Has a MAC address table to locate devices in topology (CAM table)
	Phyiscal & Logical topology: Star
	Performing processing in software (slower than switches)
	Receives a frame, checks the MAC table (noting down the source MAC on the port the frame came from)
		If it has the dest MAC in its table, it sends the traffic on that port
		Else it sends the frame to through all ports except the one it was received on
	A collision on any given port doesn't affect the other ports (each port is its own collision domain)
	Single Broadcast Domain (all devices will receive a broadcast on the network)
	Limited # of ports compared to switches
	Replaced by switches

Switch
	Layer 2 device
	Uses hardware for processing with ASICs (application specific integrated circuits)
	Phyiscal & Logical topology: Star
	Does not solve bridge problems, but they're encountered
	Each port is a separate collision domain
	Single Broadcast Domain
	Advantages:
		Support many more ports than bridges
		WAY faster than software processing, moving traffic at wire speed (as if the switch wasn't even there)
		Bandwidth is not split up between ports (no throughput degradation)

Half Duplex
	Only one party can transmit at any given time
	Hubs (CSMA/CD)

Full Duplex
	Both parties can transmit and receive at the same time
	Switches can use full duplex (DISABLES COLLISION DETECTION)
	Effectively double throughput, but risks collisions
	If one device choose full duplex and the other chooses half duplex, this will cause degraded throughput

Either configure both sides manually or set them both to auto-negotiation to avoid duplex mismatches
	Use command duplex x and speed x [Mbps]

Router
	Layer 3 device
	Use IP addresses to decide what interface to transmit out of
		Can have serial interfaces and ethernet interfaces (would use MAC addresses)
	Maintains a routing table of IP addresses (use NETWORK addresses, not individual IP addresses)
	Don't forward broadcasts
	Routing Between Subnets
		1. PC checks if the IP address its trying to communicate with is in the same subnet
		2. Assuming it isn't, traffic is sent to the default gateway
			The source IP & MAC are the source PC, the destination IP is set for the remote computer, BUT the source MAC address is set to the router
		3. Router strips layer 2 headers, then routing table is consulted to determine the subnet with the correct remote host
		4. Router forwards traffic to appropriate subnet
			If the router does not have the MAC address for the remote host, an ARP broadcast is sent out to get it
		5. Once the router has the MAC address for the remote host, the traffic is finally forwarded
			Has the same layer 3 info, but layer 2 is rewritten so the source MAC is the router and the dest MAC is the remote host
