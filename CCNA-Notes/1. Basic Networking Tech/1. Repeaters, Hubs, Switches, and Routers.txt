Repeater:
	Receives an ethernet signal and repeats it (prevents signal from dying off at longer distances)
Hub (Layer 1):
	Receives an ethernet signal and repeats it through a bunch of ports
Switch (Layer 2):
	Receives network traffic and actually reads the ethernet (layer 2) frames to intelligently route the traffic to the correct endpoint
	A layer 3 switch is a switch with routing capability (uses IP addresses to route between VLANs/subnets)
Bridge:
	Intermediate device between hub and switch (learned MAC address location with software while switches use hardware ASICs [application specific integrated circuits])
Router (Layer 3):
	Routes traffic from one network to another (think ethernet to IP and back again)
		Example: home router connects our home network (LAN) to the internet (WAN)
