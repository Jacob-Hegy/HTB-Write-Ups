Unshield Twisted Pair (UTP)
		4 pairs make up the wire
		Less expensive and easier to install than shielded twisted pairs and coaxial cables
	
Straight-through Cable
	Type of twisted, straight-through copper cable
	Common in LANs
	Each pin on connected devices connects to the corresponding pin on the other device (pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, etc.)
	MDI (media indepedent interface) - ethernet connection common on NICs of PCs
	Used for PC -> Switch, PC -> Bridge, PC -> Hub, Router -> Switch

Crossover Cable
	Swaps the pins so that proper connections can be made between devices with the same pin layout
		Example: imagine device1 uses pin1 for TX+, pin2 for TX-, pin3 for RX+, and pin6 for RX- (pins 4, 5, 7, and 8 are unused)
		If device1 conects to a device with the same pin layout, a crossover cable is used so pin1 connects to pin3 (TX+ -> RX+) and pin2 to pin6 (TX- -> RX-) on both devices
	Used for Router -> Router, Switch -> Switch, PC -> PC, Hub -> Hub, Bridge -> Switch, PC -> Server, Hub -> Switch

Auto MDI/MDIX (medium dependent interface crossover)
	Normally routers and PCs use MDI, and switches and hubs will use MDIX
	Automatically switches to MDI or MDIX when the cable is connected to avoid having to worry about choosing either a straight-through or crossover cable
	Not always used (legacy devices)

Cable Categories
	Higher category
		More twists = less susceptible to electromagnetic interference BUT more stringent specs for crosstalk and system noise
	CAT6a - up to 500 MHz, supports 10 Gbps - 100m
	CAT7 - up to 600 MHz, supports 10 Gbps - 100m
	CAT6a & CAT7 are generally recommended for new installations

Direct Attachment Cable (DAC) Copper Twinax
	Up to 15 meters
	SFP (small form-factor pluggable): hot-pluggable transceiver to support multiple media types (ex. fiber or copper)
	Inserted into SFP+ slot

Rollover Cable
	Special cable used to connect to console port (DB9 to RJ45/DB9)
	All pins are inverted (pin1 -> pin8, pin2 -> pin7, etc.)
