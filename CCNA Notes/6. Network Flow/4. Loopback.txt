Loopback interfaces are logical interfaces on a router
	Won't go down unless manually shut
		Good for ensuring connection to a router (ex. SSH or Telnet to the loopback interface of the router)
sh ip route to show possible connection routes to various IP addresses
ip add to add an IP address to an interface (use with loopback interfaces to create multiple IPs for them)

OSPF
	OSPF uses loopback addresses to identify a given router
	Router ID is set as the highest IP loopback address OR the highest interface IP address
