# CCNA Prep

I've worked through security oriented certifications already, but I haven't spent as much time as I'd like getting my hands dirty with hardware networking.
That's led me to pursuing a CCNA. I'll be uploading notes for each section as I go through so anyone else can use them as well in their endeavors.

## Study Resources
I'm using a mix of two Udemy courses at the moment, those being:
- [Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA 200-301 Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-cisco-ccna-200-301-course/)
- [David Bombal's CCNA Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/#overview)

They both have YouTube channels as well that provide guidance for your studies that I recommend:
- [Jeremy's IT Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremysITLab)
- [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal)
