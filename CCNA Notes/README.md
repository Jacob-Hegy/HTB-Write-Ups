# CCNA Prep

I've worked through security oriented certifications already, but I haven't spent as much time as I'd like getting my hands dirty with hardware networking.
That's led me to pursuing a CCNA. I'll be uploading notes for each section as I go through so anyone else can use them as well in their endeavors.

## Disclaimer

I will be the first to admit, these notes won't be for everyone. I already have a background in IT and computer science, so these notes will be appropriate for someone with a similar background. Some of the more basic stuff that I'll be skipping over are:
- Binary
- Hexadecimal
- Wireshark
- IP address fundamentals
- MAC addresses

That's not an exhaustive list, just a few topics to give you an idea of the level of stuff I will be glossing over as opposed to doing detailed notes for. I encourage those that lack knowledge in any topics I seemingly bring up out of nowhere to go through the courses themselves. They'll cover those fundamentals that I'm using as a bar for entry.

## "What about labs?"

A critical part of studying for the CCNA is completing labs within Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3. I might throw together write-ups for the labs as I go through the courses that will give a detailed walkthrough for solving them. It'll depend on the complexity of the given lab and how necessary I'd deem a write-up for it, but that's not to say there won't be any. Just TBD as of now.

## Study Resources
I'm using a mix of two Udemy courses at the moment, those being:
- [Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA 200-301 Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-cisco-ccna-200-301-course/)
- [David Bombal's CCNA Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/#overview)

They both have YouTube channels as well that provide guidance for your studies that I recommend:
- [Jeremy's IT Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremysITLab)
- [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal)
