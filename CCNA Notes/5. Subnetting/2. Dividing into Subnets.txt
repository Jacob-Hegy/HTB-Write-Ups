Good practice is a maximum of 254 hosts on a subnet (Class C)
# of hosts supported on a subnet = 2^n - 2 where n is the # of bits in the host portion
# of networks = 2^n where n is the # of bits in the subnet portion

Example: ABC Ltd has been allocated subnet 10.1.1.0/24 for a small office in London. Split the subnet into smaller subnets, each supporting 14 machines
	Question is using number of hosts, therefore use host formula
		2^n - 2 = 14, therefore n = 4
			Thus we need 4 bits in the host portion to support 14 hosts per subnet
		Original network: 10.1.1.0/24
		New networks:
			1. 10.1.1.0/28 | Subnet bits: 0000, Host bits: 0000
			2. 10.1.1.16/28 | Subnet bits: 0001, Host bits: 0000
			3. 10.1.1.32/28 | Subnet bits: 0010, Host bits: 0000
			4. 10.1.1.48/28 | Subnet bits: 0011, Host bits: 0000
			...
			n. 10.1.1.240/28 | Subnet bits: 1111, Host bits: 0000
			What's happening is the "subnet bits", or the bits that were taken away from the host portion, are incrementing up
			Each increment of the subnet bits is a new network

Example 2: ABC Ltd has been allocated subnet 10.128.192.0/18. We must split the subnet into 30 subnets with as many hosts as possible on each subnet
	Question is using number of subnets, therefore use network formula
		2^n = 30, therefore n = 5 because the first n be true for 2^n >= 30 is 5
			Thus, we need to remove 5 bits from the host portion and turn them into subnet bits
		Original network: 10.128.192.0/18 ... 11 | 00000 | 0.00000000
		New networks:
			1. 10.128.194.0/23
			2. 10.128.196.0/23
			3. 10.128.198.0/23
			4. 10.128.200.0/23
			...
			32. 10.128.254.0/23
