Example: PC1 has IP address 192.168.10.18/24
	What IP address would router1 be configured to if it is to use the first IP address in the same subnet as PC1?
	What broadcast address is used by PC1?
	What IP address would router1 be configured to if it is to use the last IP address in the same subnet as PC1?
	What subnet is PC1 a part of?

Method 1 - Binary
	Network/Subnet Address: fill host portion of address with 0s
	Broadcast Address: fill host portion of address with 1s
	First Host: fill the host portion of an address with 0s except for the last bit which is set to 1
	Last Host: fill the host portion of an address with 1s except the last bit which is set to 0
	Network/Subnet is always 1 less than the first host
	Broadcast Address is always 1 greather than the last host

Answering the example:
	Network/Subnet Address = 192.168.10.0
	Broadcast Address: 192.168.10.255
	First Host: 192.168.10.1
	Lsat Hose: 192.168.10.254

Second Example: PC2 has IP address 172.16.35.123/20
	Network/Subnet Address: 172.16.32.0
	Broadcast Address: 172.16.47.255
	First Host: 172.16.32.1
	Last Host: 172.16.47.254

Third Example: PC3 has IP address of 172.16.129.1/17
	Network/Subnet Address: 172.16.128.0
	Broadcast Address: 172.16.255.255
	First Host: 172.16.128.1
	Last Host: 172.16.255.254
