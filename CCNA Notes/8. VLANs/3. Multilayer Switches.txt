Native VLAN
	Setting native VLAN to an unused VLAN is best practice
	Frames are untagged (allows for faster traffic flow due to smaller packets)
	2 Config Methods
		1. encapsulation dot1q vlan-id native
		2. vlan-id native

Layer 3 Switch (Multilayer Switch)
	Capable of both switching and routing
		Sees both MAC addresses and IP addresses
	You can assign IP address to its interfaces
	Capable of making virtual interfaces for each VLAN & assign them IP addresses
	You can configure routes on it like a router
	Capable of inter-VLAN routing
	Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs)
		Virtual interfaces you can assign IP addresses to in a multilayer switch
		Configure each PC to ues the SVI as their gateway, not the router
		The PCs will send traffic to the switch and the switch will route it to the appropriate VLAN
		Set a default route to the router so that any traffic destined for outside the network will go to the router
		interface x - allows you to create an SVI on the VLAN x
	USE THE COMMAND ip routing TO ENABLE A SWITCH AS A LAYER 3 SWITCH
	USE no switchport ON AN INTERFACE TO CONFIGURE IT AS A ROUTED PORT (enables Layer 3)
	Command ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 x sets it so that the default route is set to IP address x
