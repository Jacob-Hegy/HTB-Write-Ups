RJ45 = standard ethernet port
	DO NOT CONNECT A ROLLOVER CABLE FROM THE ETHERNET PORT ON YOUR PC TO THE CONSOLE PORT OF YOUR CISCO ROUTER/SWITCH
		IT WILL BLOW THE PORT
	Old Solution
		Instead, you'd use a male RJ45 to female DB9 (serial) cable, connecting the DB9 to the PC and the RJ45 to the router
	New Solution
		1. Use a USB to male DB9 cable, then connect that to the female DB9 to male RJ45 cable
		2. Use a USB-A to USB-A cable between the PC and router/switch

Configuring the router/switch:
	After connecting the router/switch to the PC, check what port the device is connected to in the Device Manager
	Using PuTTY, connect to the appropriate port to establish a serial connection with the switch
		Use "en" in the console to enter privileged [root] mode (starts in user mode)
			...> means you're in user mode
			...# means you're in privileged mode

Common Commands:
	en: stands for "enable"; enters privileged mode
		disable: returns to user mode
	?: shows available commands
	sh ver OR show version: shows the model of the device as well as some additional information
	configure terminal OR conf t: enters global configuration mode
		host x/hostname x: sets the name of the device to x
		end: returns to privileged mode
	copy running-config startup-config OR wr: saves the configuration from the memory to the hard drive
	show cdp neighbors: shows all neighbors directly connected to router
	exit: exit the device

Connecting to a router's console in Packet Capture:
	Connect a PC's RS-232 port to the router's console port via a console cable
