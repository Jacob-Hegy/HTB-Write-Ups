
Unicast (one endpoint to another endpoint):
	Class A: 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 (first bit of IP address is a 0)
	Class B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 (first 2 bits of IP address are 10)
	Class C: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 (first 3 bits of IP address are 110)		

Multicast (one endpoint to multiple):
	Class D: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 (first 4 bits of IP address are 1110)

Reserved:
	Class E: 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 (first 4 bits of IP address are 1111)

Directed Broadcast Address (send data to all hosts on subnet):
	Fill host portion with 1s
		ex. if host is 172.31.0.1/16 then directed broadcast is 172.31.255.255
	Not typically sent between subnets (disable to prevent DoS)

Local Broadcast Address (communicate with all hosts on local network):
	255.255.255.255
		ex. DHCP protocol
	ALWAYS dropped by layer 3 routers and switches
		Can be overwritten by enabling DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay
		Router/Switch will then act as a proxy for the device requesting an IP address from the DHCP server

Local Loopback Address (host communicates with itself):
	Anything in range of 127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254 works as a loopback address
	::1 is the loopback address in IPv6
	Routers have their own loopback address that does not fit within the defined range of local loopback addresses
	
Private Addresses (RFC 1918):
	10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255/8
	172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255/16
	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255/24
	Blocked by all ISPs
	Must be NAT'd (network address translated) to some public IP address before sending traffic on the internet
		Typically done by the router

Automatic Private IP Address [APIPA] (RFC 3927):
	Used when a PC cannot access a DHCP server to get a private IP address
	169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.255/16
	Example scenario: connecting two PCs directly with an ethernet cable)
	Cannot be routed though, similar to private IP addresses

Subnet Mask:
	Used to determine what portion of the IP address is host and what is network
	Example: PC1 @ 10.1.1.1 could communicate with PC2 @ 10.1.2.1 if they're in the same subnet OR would send it to the router if they're in different subnets
		10.1.1.1/16 and 10.1.2.1/16 are in the same subnet
		10.1.1.1/24 and 10.1.2.1/24 are in different subnets
	Same subnet = direct traffic
	Different subnet = default gateway necessary
	Class A Mask: 255.0.0.0 (/8)
	Class B Mask: 255.255.0.0 (/16)
	Class C Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)
	In order to determine if a given device is on the same subnet:
		Perform logical && the network portion of the IP address of the two endpoints
			If it returns 1, send an ARP request to the local subnet to look for the endpoint
			If it returns 0, send the packet to the default gateway
	Discontiguous subnet masks are not supported
		Example: 240.255.3.191 (11110000.11111111.00000011.11000000) is not supported

CIDR (Classless Interdomain Routing):
	Replaced classful IP addresses
		Example: Uses 10.0.0.0/8 instead of 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 (it's what you're used to)
	Very helpful for getting the proper number of IP addresses
		Example: a company needs their network to support 3000 IP addresses
			Class A = 16777214 host addresses
			Class B = 65534 host addresses
			Class C = 254 host addresses
			All too many or too little
				CIDR fixes this by allowing the subnet to be tweaked as needed
			Solution: create a subnet with the mask /20
				32 - ceil(log2(3000))
			A subnet with the range of IP addresses x.x.x.x/20 would work for their purposes
