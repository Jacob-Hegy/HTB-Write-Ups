VLAN = separate broadcast domain/logical network (subnet)
	Group devices logically (ex. IT team, accounting staff, etc.)
	Good for segmentation
	Implement ACLs to control what users have access to what VLANs
	Implemented at Layer 2

Focus on logical topology of the network
	Example: Imagine a star topology where PCA, B, C, and D are connected across a central router
	If PCA and PCD were to be put into one VLAN while PCB and PCC sit in another VLAN, logically its as if its two separate sets of computers and routers

By default, all interfaces are configured on VLAN 1

Trunking
	Allows multiple VLANs to traverse a link
	802.1Q
		Dest | Src | TAG | Len/Etype | Data | FCS
		Tag: TPID (0x8100) | PRI [priority; prioritizes certain traffic types] | CFI | VLAN ID
		VLAN ID allows the creation of VLANs
			12 bits long, allowing 4096 VLANs
		When an interface is setup as a trunk, they can receive tagged packets
		Management traffic is sent over the native VLAN (STP BPDU, DTP)
			Always use VLAN 1: CDP (allows us to view directly connected devices), VTP (dynamically update switches with changes made to other switches), PAgP, UDLD
		ENSURE the native VLANs on both sides of the trunk are the same

Port Assignment
	Static (set by an admin for example)
	Dynamic (changes the VLAN being used based on the MAC address in received frames)
	Voice (used for VOIP phones)

VTP
	Layer 2 protocol
	Allows the propagration of VLAN info across switches (addition, deletion, and renaming of VLANs)
	Propagated across trunk links
	Uses MAC address 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC
	Messages
		Summary Advertisements
			Sends out a notification that there's been a change, and other switches will respond to receive the latest revision information
		Subset Advertisements
		Advertisement requests
	By default, devices belong in a null domain/logical
	Only devices in the same domain will be updated by VTP
	Uses a revision number to maintain what the most up-to-date revision is (number increments by one with each update)
