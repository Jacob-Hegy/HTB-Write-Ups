Unicast = one to one transmission
Broadcast = one to all transmission (typically limited to only the local segment)
Multicast = one to some transmission (only subscribers receive traffic)

Layer 1 = Physical (RJ45)
Layer 2 = Data Link (MAC addresses)
Layer 3 = Network (IP addresses)
Layer 4 = Transport (TCP/UDP)

Bus Topology
	All devices are connected on a single cable
	Clients all share the comm line (cable = bus)
		All devices receive frames from any device sending data
	10base5 = thicknet (500 meters)
	10base2 = thinnet (185 meters)
		Used coaxial cable
		Max speed = 10 Mbps (shared between all devices)
		Max segment length = 185 meters
		Baseband - only allows a single signal (signal uses all frequencies)
		Broadband - allows multiple signals over a coaxial cable (signals use different frequencies)
	Terminators placed at the end of the bus to prevent the signal from bouncing back
	Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
		A device must check if any other device is using the bus first before sending data (done to avoid collisions)
		When a collision is detected, a backoff or JAM signal is sent (tells the devices to backoff and not attempt to retransmit)
		Collision probability increases with number of devices
	Longer cable = weak signal
	Cable break anywhere in the bus will take the whole bus down (no longer has a terminator on one)
	Using bandwidth above 30% often leads to collisions
		Effective bandwidth of a four device 10base2 bus: 10/4 * .3 = .75 Mbps
	Replaced with 10baseT

10baseT
	Replaced 10base2
	Twisted pair ethernet
	Refers to the use of cable containing insulated copper wires twisted together in pairs
	Max segment length = 100 meters w/o signal regen device
		Cable in thinner and more flexible
	Often unshielded, but shielded is used in environments with excessive electromagnetic interference
	Uses RJ45 connectors

MAC Address:
	First 24 bits = Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) which identifies the company that made the device
	Last 24 bits = Vendor assigned end station address (uniquely identifies each NIC)
	If the least significant bit of the first byte is 0, device is unicast, if it's 1 it's multicast
	If the second least significant bit of the first byte is 0, the device is globally unique MAC address (OUI enforced), else it's locally administered (MAC address has been modified)
