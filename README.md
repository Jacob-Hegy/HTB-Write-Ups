# My Security Projects

This is a collection of various cybersecurity projects I've created/completed. It's a mix of write-ups, stuff I've come up with, and a few other things.

At the time of writing this, only a few write-ups have been uploaded. I'm in the process of organizing the project files before uploading them, so check back later for more additions!

## Who am I?

My name is Jacob Hegy. I recently completed my Bachelor of Computer Science @ the University of Houston and I'm working on continuing to develop my skillset in cybersecurity.
My main focus is defensive security, in particular security analysis and incident response. I currently have my CompTIA Security+ and CySA+, and I'm looking into pursuing a CISM.
I host forensic workshops for the Information Security team at UofH to help build up my peers and get them a solid start in cybersecurity.

## Layout

The write-ups are sorted into various categories. Currently there's just the "Sherlocks" folder, but more will be added as challenges are completed. You'll either find the respective .md of each challenge within the folders or a folder named after the challenge that contains both the .md and any code that was used.

Any projects that I upload will feature a README of their own for a detailed explanation on what all is going on.


All challenges are completed in a Kali Linux 2023.4 VM running on VirtualBox or on my Windows 10 host.

```Any packages that I download for a given challenge will be listed like so.```

Any tools that I used for the HackTheBox or CTF challenges can be found in this [tool list](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/HTB-Write-Ups/blob/main/Tool%20List.md).

## Corrections

HackTheBox occasionally makes changes to the questions for challenges on their site. If you notice an out-of-date answer in one of my write-ups, feel free to submit the issue and I'll get around to it as soon as I can. I am a one man team, so please understand if it takes a bit for things to get fixed!

## Wrapping Up

That's just about it! I hope my solutions help you out in your security endeavors and my creations inspire you to create some stuff of your own! If you end up using any of my code in a write-up of your own, I'd appreciate being given proper credit!

I can't make any promises on how regularly I'll upload. It'll depend on what my schedule looks like at any given time, but once I complete a challenge or bang out a project it will eventually find its way onto here.

**Thanks for your time! Happy hacking!**
