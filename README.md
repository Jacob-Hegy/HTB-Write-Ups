# My HackTheBox Write-Ups

This is a collection of the write-ups I've created while completing various challenges on HackTheBox as well as the associated files with any of my solutions.

## Who am I?

My name is Jacob Hegy. I recently completed my Bachelor of Computer Science @ the University of Houston and I'm working on continuing to develop my skillset in cybersecurity.
My main focus is defensive security, in particular security analysis and incident response. I currently have my CompTIA Security+ and CySA+, and I'm looking into pursuing a CISM.
I host forensic workshops for the Information Security team at UofH to help build up my peers and get them a solid start in cybersecurity.

## Layout

The write-ups are sorted into various categories. Currently there's just the "Sherlocks" folder, but more will be added as challenges are completed. You'll either find the respective .md of each challenge within the folders or a folder named after the challenge that contains both the .md and any code that was used.
I'm doing all this in a Kali Linux 2023.4 VM running on VirtualBox.

```Any packages that I download for a given challenge will be listed like so.```

## Corrections

HackTheBox occasionally makes changes to the questions for challenges on their site. If you notice an out-of-date answer in one of my write-ups, feel free to submit the issue and I'll get around to it as soon as I can. I am a one man team, so please understand if it takes a bit for things to get fixed!

## Wrapping Up

That's just about it! I hope my solutions help you out in your security endeavors! If you end up using any of my code in a write-up of your own, I'd appreciate being given proper credit!

I can't make any promises on how regularly I'll upload. It'll depend on what my schedule looks like at any given time, but once I complete a challenge it will eventually find its way onto here.

**Thanks for your time! Happy hacking!**
