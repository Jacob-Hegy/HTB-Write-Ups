# Annoying Colleagues
### DISCLAIMER: any executables that I link in this write-up are malware; exercise caution if you choose to download them
We've got a virtual machine memory dump and a USB image file.

Before we can get started, we'll have to mount the `usb4.img` file. If you're on Linux, you can do that with the following: `sudo mount usb4.img <mount_location>`

Once that's configured, it's time to take stock of what happened. The USB looks to be full of a bunch of executables, so discerning exactly which one is malicious is going to be a bit hard. If you have a VirusTotal API token, you can hash all the executables and load them in for analysis. I don't, so I'll have to do some more in-depth analysis to figure out where to look. I'm gonna be using Volatility Framework for this.

Running `vol -f mem.vmem windows.info.Info`, I get the following info:
```

```
The backup was captured at 18.06.25. I'm gonna check this against the results from `vol -f mem.vmem windows.pslist.PsList` to see the programs that were running right before shutdown. I'm gonna keep the window for possible malicious execution pretty tight because the user reportedly closed their laptop and removed the USB fast, so it's unlikely the malicious program(s) ran for long.

The following processes were running within 18.06.XX:
```
rainbow.exe
conhost.exe
MusNotification
MoUsoCoreWorke
svchost.exe
WinStore.App.exe
ApplicationFra
RuntimeBroker.exe
cmd.exe
conhost.exe
```

I've now got an idea of what processes I might want to look into. Of those listed, `rainbow.exe` jumps out as an outlier. Here's a bit more information I was able to garner off of it using some googling and running `vol -f mem.vmem windows.pstree.PsTree` and `vol -f mem.vmem windows.netstat.NetStat`:
- No online documentation for a `rainbow.exe`; extremely suspicious
- Parent process is explorer.exe, it was actively opened (potentially off the USB?)
- Has an open UDP connection on port 1337
- `rainbow.exe` is on the USB, the fact that it was a running process on the computer is a massive indicator that it might be to blame

At this point, I'm fairly confident that `rainbow.exe` is malicious in nature. To confirm my suspicions, I extracted the active executable's dump file from the .vmem with `vol -f mem.vmem windows.dumpfiles.DumpFiles`. Hashing the file `file.0x908d1d9f4af0.0x908d1d54b010.ImageSectionObject.rainbow.exe.img` and tossing that into VirusTotal, we get the following alerts:
![Rainbow Dump Analysis](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/assets/85857129/ade8565a-078f-4075-a166-855c07d032cd)

With our suspicions confirmed, we're gonna toss the executable `rainbow.exe` currently on the USB drive into Ghidra for further analysis. If you wanna check out the full code for yourself, you can download the executable [here](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/blob/main/Forensics/rainbow.exe) or just check out the decompiled code [here](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/blob/main/Forensics/rainbow%20Decompiled.c). This is it was able to garner from file:
![Ghidra Analysis of Rainbow](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/assets/85857129/d7f75ce6-0528-4ce0-8f76-b23a8a662fb3)

Essentially what's going on is `rainbow.exe` is attempting to create a socket to communicate with some outside server (likely beaconing to a C2 server). If it's able to successfully connect, it receives some info from the server and then executes `netbtugc.exe` from the E drive (given the fact that the C drive is the local drive, the E drive is probably the USB).
![netbtugc exe Call](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/assets/85857129/f179249c-7652-4419-9843-5a633247c230)

Let's shift our focus to `netbtugc.exe`. We can extract it off of the USB. Before I even toss it in Ghidra, I'm gonna run its md5 hash in VirusTotal to see if I get any hits. Sure enough, we get a few alerts on it:
![netbtugc exe Virus Total](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/assets/85857129/4d0d244e-4e88-4c40-aa05-6153bd0ce640)

So into Ghidra we go once again, this time with `netbtugc.exe`. Walking through the disassembled executable, we can make some notes about the variable's values as well as the program flow to take a guess at what's going on. Once again, if you want to walk through the executable yourself, you can download it [here](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/blob/main/Forensics/netbtugc.exe) or just check out the decompiled code [here](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/blob/main/Forensics/netbtugc%20Decompiled.c)
```
local_10 = "shutdown /s /t 5 /c "
local_108 = "xeff2xC|57up1dc0w0rkccre3r00xfer"
local_104 = 68 (0x44) ==> D
uStack_103 = 68 (0x44) ==> D
uStack_101 = 123 (0x7b) ==> {

local_128 ==> first 30 bytes are 0's
local_128 = uStack_100 + uStack_101 + uStack_102 + uStack_103 + local_104
local_120 = local_fc
local_ee = 0x7d ==> }
local_148 = the first three bytes of local_f0
local_145 = 0
local_98 = "{local_10} \ {&local_128}{local_148}\" = "shutdown /s /t 5 /c \ {&local_128}{local_148}\"
local_98 is a command that shuts down the computer after 5 seconds and displays the flag

The checks between local_18 and local_20 prevent the flag from being displayed on any computer that is not the target, instead display the message "Go away" prior to shutdown
```
Going through the code, what's happening is values are being loaded into local memory addresses and concatenated together to create the flag. The IP address of the local machine is then being checked in the following code:
```
  local_18 = "192.168.111.128";
  local_20 = getIPAddress();
  _Size = strlen(local_18);
  iVar1 = memcmp(local_18,local_20,_Size);
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    local_28 = "shutdown /s /t 5 /c \"Go away\"";
    system("shutdown /s /t 5 /c \"Go away\"");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(-1);
  }
  system(local_98);
  return 0;
```
If the local IP address is 192.168.111.128, the program will execute `local_98`, which we've already established will shut down the computer after 5 seconds and display the flag as it's doing so. If the IP address does not match, it will still shutdown the computer but it will display `"Go away"` instead.

I can run this in a Windows 10 sandbox if I configure the sandbox's static IP to match the one being checked by the program. Luckily, I already have one created for sandboxing. We'll boot it up, configure the static IP address to 192.168.111.128, and download `netbtugc.exe`. Once we do all that and execute the file, we get the following result:
![Result](https://github.com/Jacob-Hegy/DDC-2024-Write-Ups/assets/85857129/4272fcb6-4002-4d15-98f5-f15645d6d367)

Thus, our final flag is `DDC{57up1dc0w0rk3r}`!
