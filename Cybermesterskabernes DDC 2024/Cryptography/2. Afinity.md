# Afinity
This challenge relies on an affinity cipher. In particular, we're looking at one with the formula y = (ax + b) mod 256 where $a$ is some integer in the range $[1, 256)$ and b is an integer in the range $[0, 256)$.

This algorithm is not secure, we can brute force it because we have the ciphertext and know that the first four characters will be `DDC{`. It's not elegant, you could do this pretty easily using some modulo equations, but this solution is fast and easy. We'll do so by making some modifications to the original `gen.py` file, resulting in the following
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
	 plaintext = b'DDC{'
    m = 256
    for i in range(256):
        for j in range(1, 256):
            ciphertext = affine_encrypt(plaintext, i, j, m)
            if ciphertext == "0xe9e962ea":
                print(f'Key = {(i, j)} | {ciphertext}')
```
This results in the output `Key = (135, 13) | 0xe9e962ea` meaning $a = 135$ and $b = 13$. Using these values, we'll decrypt the ciphertext with the following python script:
```Python
def encryption(x):
	return (135 * x + 13) % 256

ciphertext = "0xe9e962ea422bdc1d39965e2b341de5dc260f5050c9b2260f960f016c0f50342b6c39dcf8"
ciphertext = ciphertext[2:]
chars = {}
for i in range(256):
	chars[encryption(i)] = i
for i in range(0, len(ciphertext), 2):
	print(chr(chars[int(ciphertext[i:i+2])]), end = '')
```
This results in the following flag: `DDC{cryptography_needs_nonlinearity}`
