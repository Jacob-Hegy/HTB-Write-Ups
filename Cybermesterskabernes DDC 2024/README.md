# DDC 2024 Write-Ups
Hej! 

These are my write-ups for the DDC Seniors Qualifying Round. They'll include the flag as well as detailed instructions to help you understand how to get the solution!

### In full transparency...
I didn't actually start on these challenges until 18/3 (I found the CTF the day after it ended), so I'm uploading these write-ups as I do the challenges. No clue how long it'll take me. I'd like to do all of them for fun, but we'll see!
